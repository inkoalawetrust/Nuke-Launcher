VERSION 1.1:

-Added radiation poisoning, when the nuke explodes, all nearby living creatures, including the player, will begin getting radiation poisoning for a random amount of time. You can avoid being harmed by this effect by wearing a radsuit.
-Added a screen flash, if a player stares at the nuclear explosion for the first moment of it appearing, their screen will flash white. This was made by Agent_Ash as I had no idea how to do it myself.
-Changed the formatting in the code, and by that I mean I added a ton of probably unnecesary capitalization.
