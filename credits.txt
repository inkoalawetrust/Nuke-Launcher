The sounds are from Unreal Tournament (I think)

The original DECORATE code and some of the sprites were made by Daniel (IDK who that is.), though I basically rewrote the entire thing from scratch.

The rest of the sprites are from 3D Realms

Agent_Ash for helping me with several things related to the weapons' code and making the screen flash effect that is produced if you look at the explosion for the first few moments.

Cherno for figuring out why the fuck the nukes didn't make any noise when remotely detonated, turns out it was just because they didn't have global attenuation, even though every other A_PlaySound or A_StartSound in the code that plays the exact same sound didn't need ATTN_NONE to be set in their parameters for the sound to play.
