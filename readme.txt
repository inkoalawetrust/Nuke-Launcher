The mod includes 3 new actors that are placeable in the map editor, all 3 have editor keys and editor numbers to be categorized and appear in the editor, those actors are:


Nuclear Cyberdemon, a giant red variant of the Cyberdemon that fires nukes of its' own, has 10000 health and is practically immune from nuclear explosions except for taking a tiny bit of damage.

Nuclear Missile, the ammo type that the launcher uses, you can only have a max of 4 missiles and can't fire another one if you've already fired a nuke that is currently either in the air or in the process of exploding.

Nuclear Missile Launcher, the actual weapon that fires the nuclear missiles, pressing the altfire key while a nuke is in the air allows you to remotely detonate it.

There is also an actor called "NuclearExplosion" which as the name says, immediately generates a nuclear explosion within 2 tics of being spawned.

Do note that a single nuclear explosion generates over 100 dynamic lights each, which can obviously cause some major performance impact when they are all still on screen, however there are only really supposed to be 2-3 nukes being detonated in a map at once, so it shouldn't be much of an issue.
